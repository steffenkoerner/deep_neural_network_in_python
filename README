# Implementing a deep neural network with python

The .ipynb file contains the implemention of a neural network in python.

The network consists of three layers. An input, hidden and an output layer.
The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations.
The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥.
